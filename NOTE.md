# AUTHOR'S NOTE

## Purpose

This is basically just a thought experiment. It started based on a reply on twitter to a post about a dating platform for nerds and someone said 'github.' I thought it would be fun to explore what something like that might look like and how you might do it with as much security as possible while hosting it entirely on github.

I dont expect anyone will actually use it, but perhaps they do get some ideas about thinking outside the box? More than anything its a proof of concept. Dont take it to seriously

## Terms / AUP

I reviewed github terms / AUP and, as best as I can tell, this doesnt actually violate them (unless maybe it got really big and a lot of people started using it?). Having said that, if it turns out that it is something github prefer no to host, that is fine by me. Please dont ban my github account is all. I'd be happy to remove it.

## Conclusion

Thats pretty much it. Take it or leave it.
